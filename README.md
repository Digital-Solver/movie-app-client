# Scynapse - React Client

Live Site: https://kds-scynapse.netlify.app/

Scynapse is a full-stack web application that allows users to access information about movies and save their favorites. Built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js), Scynapse consists of a server-side API and database, and a client-side interface. This is the repository for the React client-side code.

As the developer of Scynapse, I was responsible for building both the server-side and client-side of the application. One of the main challenges I faced was integrating the React front-end with the Express backend and MongoDB database. It required a lot of testing and debugging, but I was eventually able to successfully connect the two and retrieve and manipulate data as needed.

Another challenge I encountered during this project was implementing state management using Redux. Initially, it seemed like a daunting task, but by breaking it down into smaller chunks and tackling each piece one at a time I was able to learn to properly implement Redux in my code. This methodical approach allowed me to more easily understand and debug any issues that arose, and eventually I was able to successfully implement Redux for state management.

One of the features that I am particularly proud of is the seamless and intuitive UX/UI throughout the entire app. Building the interface from scratch using wireframes and testing it on various browsers was a great learning experience and I am happy with how it turned out. The app's aesthetic design is also a highlight, as it required careful planning and attention to detail to create a cohesive and visually appealing experience for users.

Working on the Scynapse project was a fantastic learning opportunity for me. It allowed me to improve my skills in full-stack MERN, and also allowed me to use my problem-solving and creative thinking skills. I believe this project has greatly enhanced my portfolio and demonstrates my front end abilities with React.
